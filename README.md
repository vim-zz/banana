**Explanation:**

1.  **Title (`#`):** Clear and concise name.
2.  **Short Intro:** One sentence explaining the core purpose.
3.  **Description (`##`):** Expands slightly on the purpose and **includes the requested list of fruits** as an example of what users can add. I added emojis for a bit of visual appeal.
4.  **Features (`##`):** A brief bulleted list of the main functionalities. Keep this short for a "small" README.
5.  **How to Use (`##`):** Simple, step-by-step instructions on basic interaction.
6.  **Separator/Closing (`---`):** Adds a visual break and a friendly closing remark.

This keeps it brief ("small") while covering the essential information and fulfilling your requirement for the fruit list example. You can adjust the features and usage steps based on your specific app's functionality.
